Nonetheless, researchers and practitioners often face challenges when performing this task due to long computation times and the cost of licensed software. R{\textasciicircum}5{\textasciicircum} is a multimodal transport network router that offers multiple routing features, such as calculating travel times over a time window and returning multiple itineraries for origin/destination pairs. This paper describes r5r, an open-source R package that leverages R{\textasciicircum}5{\textasciicircum} to efficiently compute travel time matrices and generate detailed itineraries between sets of origins and destinations at no expense using seamless parallel computing.},
